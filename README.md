Data and R Scripts for labelling accelerometer data and running a random forest model.
01. Label the accelerometer data with behavioural labels from BORIS
02. Create summary metrics and resample frequencies. This includes code adapted from (Clark, 2019; Clark et al., 2022). https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/120152, https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v701/p145-157/
03. Run random forest for each frequency and smoothing window.
